\description{
Genotype polyploid individuals from next generation
sequencing (NGS) data while assuming the genotype distribution is one of
several forms. \code{flexdog} does this while accounting for allele bias,
overdispersion, sequencing error, and possibly outlying observations
(if \code{model = "f1"} or \code{model = "s1"}). This function has more
options than \code{\link{flexdog}} and is only meant for expert users.
The method is described in detail in Gerard et. al. (2018) and
Gerard and Ferr√£o (2019).
}
\details{
Possible values of the genotype distribution (values of \code{model}) are:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"norm"}}{A distribution whose genotype frequencies are proportional
      to the density value of a normal with some mean and some standard deviation.
      Unlike the \code{"bb"} and \code{"hw"} options, this will allow for
      distributions both more and less dispersed than a binomial.
      This seems to be the most robust to violations in modeling assumptions, and so is the
      default. This prior class was developed in Gerard and Ferr√£o (2019).}
  \item{\code{"hw"}}{A binomial distribution that results from assuming that
      the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This actually does
      pretty well even when there are minor to moderate deviations from HWE.
      Though it does not perform as well as the `"norm"` option when there
      are severe deviations from HWE.}
  \item{\code{"bb"}}{A beta-binomial distribution. This is an overdispersed
      version of \code{"hw"} and can be derived from a special case of the Balding-Nichols model.}
  \item{\code{"ash"}}{Any unimodal prior. This can sometimes be sensitive to violations
      in modeling assumptions, but tends to work better than the \code{"flex"} option.
      This prior class was developed in Gerard and Ferr√£o (2019).}
  \item{\code{"s1"}}{This prior assumes the individuals are
      all full-siblings resulting
      from one generation of selfing. I.e. there is only
      one parent. This model assumes
      a particular type of meiotic behavior: polysomic
      inheritance with
      bivalent, non-preferential pairing.
      Since this is a pretty strong and well-founded prior,
      we allow \code{outliers = TRUE} when \code{model = "s1"}.}
  \item{\code{"s1pp"}}{The same as \code{"s1"} but accounts for possible
      (and arbitrary levels of) preferential
      pairing during meiosis. The only supported values of \code{ploidy} right now for
      this option are \code{4} and \code{6}.}
  \item{\code{"f1"}}{This prior assumes the individuals are all
      full-siblings resulting
      from one generation of a bi-parental cross.
      This model assumes
      a particular type of meiotic behavior: polysomic
      inheritance with
      bivalent, non-preferential pairing. Since this is
      a pretty strong
      and well-founded prior, we allow \code{outliers = TRUE}
      when \code{model = "f1"}.}
  \item{\code{"f1pp"}}{The same as \code{"f1"} but accounts for possible
      (and arbitrary levels of) preferential
      pairing during meiosis. This option is mostly untested for values of \code{ploidy}
      greater than \code{6}.}
  \item{\code{"flex"}}{Generically any categorical distribution. Theoretically,
      this works well if you have a lot of individuals. In practice, it seems to
      be much less robust to violations in modeling assumptions.}
  \item{\code{"uniform"}}{A discrete uniform distribution. This should never
      be used in practice.}
  \item{\code{"custom"}}{A pre-specified prior distribution. You specify
      it using the \code{prior_vec} argument. You should almost never
      use this option in practice.}
}

You might think a good default is \code{model = "uniform"} because it is
somehow an "uninformative prior." But it is very informative and tends to
work horribly in practice. The intuition is that it will estimate
the allele bias and sequencing error rates so that the estimated genotypes
are approximately uniform (since we are assuming that they are approximately
uniform). This will usually result in unintuitive genotyping since most
populations don't have a uniform genotype distribution.
I include it as an option only for completeness. Please don't use it.

The value of \code{prop_mis} is a very intuitive measure for
the quality of the SNP. \code{prop_mis} is the posterior
proportion of individuals mis-genotyped. So if you want only SNPS
that accurately genotype, say, 95\% of the individuals, you could
discard all SNPs with a \code{prop_mis} over \code{0.05}.

The value of \code{maxpostprob} is a very intuitive measure
for the quality of the genotype estimate of an individual.
This is the posterior probability of correctly genotyping
the individual when using \code{geno} (the posterior mode)
as the genotype estimate. So if you want to correctly genotype,
say, 95\% of individuals, you could discard all individuals
with a \code{maxpostprob} of under \code{0.95}. However, if you are
just going to impute missing genotypes later, you might consider
not discarding any individuals as \code{flexdog}'s genotype estimates will
probably be more accurate than other more naive approaches, such
as imputing using the grand mean.

In most datasets I've examined, allelic bias is a major issue. However,
you may fit the model assuming no allelic bias by setting
\code{update_bias = FALSE} and \code{bias_init = 1}.

Prior to using \code{flexdog}, during the read-mapping step,
you could try to get rid of allelic bias by
using WASP (\url{https://doi.org/10.1101/011221}). If you are successful
in removing the allelic bias (because its only source was the read-mapping
step), then setting \code{update_bias = FALSE} and \code{bias_init = 1}
would be reasonable. You can visually inspect SNPs for bias by
using \code{\link{plot_geno}}.

\code{flexdog}, like most methods, is invariant to which allele you
label as the "reference" and which you label as the "alternative".
That is, if you set \code{refvec} with the number of alternative
read-counts, then the resulting genotype estimates
will be the estimated allele dosage of the alternative allele.
