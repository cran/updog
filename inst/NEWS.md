# updog 0.99.0

* This is a complete re-working of the code in `updog`. The old version may be found in the [`updogAlpha` package](https://github.com/dcgerard/updogAlpha).
* The main function is now `flexdog`.
* An experimental approach  `mupdog` is now live. We provide no guarantees about `mupdog`'s performance.
* Oracle misclassification error rates may be calculated in `oracle_mis`.
* Genotypes can be simulated using `rgeno`.
* Next-generation sequencing data can be simulated using `rflexdog`.
